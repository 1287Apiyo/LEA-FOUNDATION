# LEA Foundation Website

## About LEA Foundation
The **LEA Foundation** was founded with the mission to empower young learners aged 9 to 18 by providing them access to technology and coding education. The foundation is partnered with the **Mukuru Slums Development Project (MSDP)**, focusing on offering opportunities to children who lack access to such resources. By introducing coding and basic computer skills, LEA aims to unlock the potential of young minds, guiding them toward a brighter technological future.

## Key Features
The LEA Foundation website highlights our programs, projects, and impact through several key sections:

1. **What We Can Do**: 
   - Focuses on providing exposure to kids aged 9-18, who otherwise might not have had the opportunity to explore technology. This section outlines our approach to closing the opportunity gap.

2. **Our Recent Projects**: 
   - Showcases the work we’ve done, such as the *Immersion and Inclusivity at MSDP* project. This project engaged learners with no prior experience in technology, introducing them to basic computer usage and making them comfortable before progressing to more advanced coding skills.

3. **Together We Can Make It Happen**:
   - A call for support, collaboration, and donations to help us expand our reach and continue providing technological training to underserved communities.

4. **Photo Gallery**:
   - Visuals of our training sessions and fun activities, giving a closer look at our hands-on approach with the learners.

## Technologies Used
The LEA Foundation website is built with the following technologies:
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**: For structuring, styling, and adding interactivity to the website.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the website is accessible and functional on different screen sizes and devices.
  
## Project Highlights
- **Partnership with MSDP**: LEA works closely with Mukuru Slums Development Project to ensure that the learners in the institution receive practical and relevant training in coding and basic computer skills.
